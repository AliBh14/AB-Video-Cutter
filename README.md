# AB-Video-Cutter
AB Video Cutter is a python-based software which is used to cut video files. 

This is the first version of the project and may not contain some features for now, but it has interesting functions. You can choose a video file, check it frame by frame, and cut from a specific frame.

In the current version, support for large video files is poor and would be improved in the upcoming versions. In addition, the GUI itself could also be improved. 

Feel free to share your ideas and questions regarding this project.
